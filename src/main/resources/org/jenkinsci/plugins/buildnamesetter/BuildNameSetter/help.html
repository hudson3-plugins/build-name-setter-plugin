    Normally, builds are named by their sequential numbers, but you can change that to something
    more meaningful to you in the context of this job.

    <p>
    The update actually happens twice during the build; once right after the check out, and once before the build is completed.
    So depending on the macro you use, you might not see the complete value until your build completes.
